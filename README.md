### A brief self-introduction
My name is Xinzhe, I am a first year master student in UBC Statistics. **Nice to meet you all!** :blush:

In my free time, I like to do the followings:
- *playing piano*
- *hiking*
- *watching movies*

### Here is a description of how I got the changes into README.md on GitHub.
- I pulled, edited locally, saved, committed, pushed to github.com.

       1. Pull from GitHub
       2. Make changes locally to local files using RStudio
       3. Save the changes
       4. Commit the changes to repo
       5. Push the commit to GitHub

- I mostly referred to our [course website]http://stat545.com/cm003-notes_and_exercises.html when working on Github, connecting RStudio to git and GitHub, and working locally.

- One of the difficult thing that I notice about working on Githubs is the terminologies. Many of the words are new to me and I sometimes have difficulty understanding the instructions because of these words. 

- I find [this website](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) helpful, it explains many terminologies used in github.

### A few reflections on my experience with Markdown
- I read up on Markdown and practiced with some of the syntax, including section headers, links, bold, italic, bullet points, image, and pdf embed.

- Here is a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) of Markdown.

- I referred to [this tutorial](http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/) when I tried to add images and gif to the README file.

### Some reflections on the experience with R Markdown for Gapminder exploration
Here is a link to the rendered [hw01_gapminder.md](https://github.com/hannahdxz/STAT545-hw01-Dong-Xinzhe/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) for the Gapminder exploration.
- First I opened a new Rmarkdown file through *File > New File > R Markdown …*
- Change the output in YAML to "github_document"
- Insert empty R chunks, via “Insert > R” in upper right of Rstudio
- Insert code to the empty R chunks
- Make comments and explanation about each R chunk
- Render the whole document via "Knit"
- Commit the changes and push to Github

Our [course website](http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html) contains more instructions on Rmarkdown. Also the [Rstudio website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) has a detailed tutorial about Rmarkdown which I find very useful.

Here is a Link to the main [STAT545 webpage](http://stat545.com/).

Thank you for visiting my README. Have a good day!
