### A brief self-introduction
My name is Xinzhe, I am a first year master student in UBC Statistics. **Nice to meet you all!** :blush:

In my free time, I like to do the followings:
- *playing piano*
- *hiking*
- *watching movies*

### Here is a description of how I got the changes into README.md on GitHub.
- I pulled, edited locally, saved, committed, pushed to github.com.

       1. Pull from GitHub
       2. Make changes locally to local files using RStudio
       3. Save the changes
       4. Commit the changes to repo
       5. Push the commit to GitHub
 
- I referred to [this tutorial](http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/) when I tried to add images and gif to the README file.

- I also find [this website](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) helpful, it explains many terminologies used in github.

### Some reflections on the experience with R Markdown
Here is a link to the rendered [hw01_gapminder.md](https://github.com/hannahdxz/STAT545-hw01-Dong-Xinzhe/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) for the Gapminder exploration.
- First I opened a new Rmarkdown file through *File > New File > R Markdown …*
- Change the output in YAML to "github_document"
- Insert empty R chunks, via “Insert > R” in upper right of Rstudio
- Insert code to the empty R chunks
- Make comments and explanation about each R chunk
- Render the whole document via "Knit"
- Commit the changes and push to Github

Our [course website](http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html) contains more instructions on Rmarkdown. Also the [Rstudio website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) has a detailed tutorial about Rmarkdown which I find very useful.

Here is a Link to the main [STAT545 webpage](http://stat545.com/).

Thank you for visiting my README. Have a good day!
